  "strategy": "LLM-optimized clockwise treatment",
  "llm_reasoning": "Treating clockwise maximizes treatment effectiveness by aligning with the morning sun position, which typically reduces camera weed detection errors, and also allows for optimal chemical adhesion due to morning dew. Moreover, this direction reduces the impact of wind drift from the west. These factors outweigh concerns about battery life and plant stress on sun-facing rows, especially since the last treatment was 3 days ago.",
